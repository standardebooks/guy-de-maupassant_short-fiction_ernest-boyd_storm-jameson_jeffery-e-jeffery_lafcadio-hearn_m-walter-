		<meta id="long-description" property="se:long-description" refines="#description">
			&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/guy-de-maupassant"&gt;Guy de Maupassant&lt;/a&gt; is considered one of the preeminent writers in the realm of the short story. In a little over a decade he produced almost three hundred stories, many of which (e.g. “Boule de Suif,” “The Little Soldier”) are judged to be classics of the genre.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;As a protégé of &lt;a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/gustave-flaubert"&gt;Flaubert&lt;/a&gt; and contemporary of &lt;a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/emile-zola"&gt;Zola&lt;/a&gt;, Maupassant was an early practitioner of naturalism, and his stories often reflect the stark, harsh outlook that marked that movement. Brutality—towards women, as a result of war, or just representing the baseness of humankind—is a common thread. Yet stories like “Beside the Bed” and “Country Courts” show that he had a sense of humor as well. But no matter the subject, what sets Maupassant’s stories apart is his unerring ability to paint the details of the story’s setting and participants in such a way that the reader feels as if they are part of the action.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;This edition includes all Maupassant stories that are known to have been translated into English, including five that have not appeared in any other English collection. It does not include the sixty-six so-called “fake” Maupassants, stories that were attributed to Maupassant but not written by him that appeared in several English collections at the turn of the twentieth century.&lt;/p&gt;

			All but a handful of the stories (in translation) are from _The Collected Novels and Stories of Guy de Maupassant_, from Alfred A. Knopf in the early 1920s. With a few exceptions, other stories not included in that collection are from _The Works of Guy de Maupassant_, _The Complete Writings of Guy de Maupassant_, and _The Complete Works of Guy de Maupassant_, in that order. That is, the story was taken from the first of those three collections, in that order, in which it appeared.
			The exceptions include "’Toine", taken from _Saint Anthony and Other Stories_, translated by Lefcadio Hearn, a highly-regarded translator of a number of Maupassant's stories in the early twentieth century. Hearn's version is a more accurate translation of the story than the one in _Collected Novels and Stories_. Four additional stories are included from a biography of Maupassant by Francis Steegmuller (the copyright was not renewed); these stories have not appeared in any other English collection. "Doctor Heraclius Gloss" was one of the earliest of Maupassant's stories, written circa 1875, but was not published until many years after his death. The included translation was published separately in 1923-24 by Brentano's Limited, and again has not been included in any other English collection.
			No transcriptions were available for any of the included stories, so all were either cleaned up from OCR from epubs provided by Internet Archive/Google Books, or were typed manually.
			The introduction is an essay Henry James wrote for _Fortnight Review_ at the height of Maupassant’s fame. It covers both his short stories and his novels up to the time of writing.
			For unknown reasons, the _Collected Novels and Stories_ collection did not translate verse that occurred in several of the stories. This edition provides translation in endnotes; these translations were obtained from translations of the poet's work if they were found in the public domain, or from one of the other three English collections mentioned above, if they were present there.
			The three latter collections also included a total of 66 stories between them that were attributed to Maupassant, but that were not written by him. These so-called "fake" Maupassant stories were correctly not included in the _Collected Novels and Stories_ collection, and are not present here. Further information on these "fake" stories can be found here (https://marvellousmaupassant.wordpress.com/2015/11/20/fake-maupassants/) and here (https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/14259/which-short-stories-are-falsely-attributed-to-guy-de-maupassant-and-why).
